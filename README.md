## Restaurant Reviews Final

The Udacity Restaurant Reviews project is part of the Front-end Web Development Nanodegree. For the this project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also added a service worker to create a seamless offline experience.

### Getting started
1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Navigate to the root directory and start a Python server to serve up the files locally.

* Check your Python version by entering `python -v`- if you don't have Python installed, visit the [Python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions.
* If you have Python 2.x, spin up a server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
* If you have Python 3.x, spin up a server with `python3 -m http.server 8000`

3. Once your server is running, visit `http://localhost:8000`
